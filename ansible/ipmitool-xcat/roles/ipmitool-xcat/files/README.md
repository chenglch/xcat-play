# Dependency rpms for sles
As sles put the dependency packages in the SDK iso, it's not a good idea to
copy and mount iso in the playbook. Just add the rpms for different system here
but this is official packages can not be open, so just copy these pakcages into
this directory.

Thees are the dependency files for sles12 and sles 11.4
